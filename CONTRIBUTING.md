# How to contribute to Spectral

First of all, thanks for considering contributing to Spectral! âœ¨ It's people like you that make tools like Spectral awesome. ðŸ’–

At Stoplight, we want contributing to Spectral to be an enjoyable and educational project for everyone. Contributions go beyond commits in pull requests. We are excited to receive contributions in the form of:

- feature ideas
- pull requests
- triaging issues
- reviewing pull requests
- implementations of Spectral in your own projects
- blog posts, talks referencing the project, tweets
- and much more!

If it is related to Spectral, we consider it a contribution. 

If you are new to contributing to open source, GitHub has created a helpful guide with lots of resources [here](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). If you want more help, post in our [Community forum](https://community.stoplight.io/c/open-source) or send an email to [support@stoplight.io](mailto:support@stoplight.io). We are happy to help you out there. 

We want to encourage everyone to be welcoming to newcomers and encourage new contributors from all backgrounds.

To help create an environment where anyone could potentially be welcome to contribute, we have a Code of Conduct that applies to the project and adjacent spaces related to Spectral. 

## Stoplight Community Code of Conduct

The Stoplight Community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. 

Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. See our reporting guidelines [here](https://github.com/stoplightio/code-of-conduct/blob/master/incident-reporting.md). Our full Code of Conduct can be found at this [link](https://github.com/stoplightio/code-of-conduct/blob/master/long-form-code-of-conduct.md#long-form-code-of-conduct).

## Development

Yarn is a package manager for your code, similar to npm. While you can use npm to use Spectral in your own project, we use yarn for development of Spectral.

1. If you don't already have the yarn package manager on your machine, install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
2. Fork the [https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) repo.
3. Git clone your fork (i.e. git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spectral.git) to your machine.
4. Run `yarn` to install dependencies and setup the project.
5. Use `yarn build && bin/run lint openapi.yml` to run Spectral from your local source tree.
6. Run `git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]` to create a new branch for your work. To help build nicer changelogs, we have a convention for branch names. Please start your branch with either `feature/{branch-name}`, `chore/{branch-name}`, or `fix/{branch-name}`. For example, if I was adding a CLI, I would make my branch name: `feature/add-cli`. 
7. Make changes, write code and tests, etc. The fun stuff!
8. Run `yarn test.prod` to test your changes.
9. Ready to `git commit`? **Important:** We use a [commit message format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) to add more semantic meaning to our git history to create automated, rich changelogs, filter what tests to run, and more. After you have `git add`, run `yarn commit` to help you create this format, or you can put it together manually and then do a regular `git commit`. Commits outside of this format will be rejected.
10. Don't forget to `git push` to your branch after you have committed changes. 

Now, you are ready to make a pull request to the Stoplight repo! ðŸ˜ƒ

If this is your first Pull Request on GitHub, here's some [help](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github). 

We have a pull request template setup that you will fill out when you open your pull request. 

> We try to respond to all pull requests and issues within 7 days. We welcome feedback from everyone involved in the project in open pull requests.
