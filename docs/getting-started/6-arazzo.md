# Arazzo Support

Spectral has a built-in [Arazzo v1](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/v1.0.0.html) ruleset that you can use to validate your Arazzo files.

Add `extends: "spectral:arazzo"` to your ruleset file to apply rules for Arazzo v1.

You can see a full list of the rules in this ruleset in [Arazzo Rules](../reference/arazzo-rules.md).
