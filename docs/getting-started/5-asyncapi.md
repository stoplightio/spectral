# AsyncAPI Support

Spectral has a built-in [AsyncAPI v2](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.0.0) ruleset that you can use to validate your AsyncAPI files.

Add `extends: "spectral:asyncapi"` to your ruleset file to apply rules for AsyncAPI v2.

You can see a full list of the rules in this ruleset in [AsyncAPI Rules](../reference/asyncapi-rules.md).
