# Spectral CLI

Once installed, Spectral can be run via the command-line:

```bash
spectral lint petstore.yaml
```

Other options include:

  --display-only-failures, -D  only output results equal to or greater than --fail-severity

The Spectral CLI supports loading documents as YAML or JSON, and validation of OpenAPI v2/v3 documents via our built-in ruleset. 

You can also provide your own ruleset file. By default, the Spectral CLI will look for a ruleset file called `.spectral.yml` or `.spectral.json` in the current working directory. You can tell spectral to use a different file by using the `--ruleset` CLI option.

Here you can build a [custom ruleset](../getting-started/rulesets.md), or extend and modify our [core OpenAPI ruleset](https://stoplight.io/p/docs/gh/stoplightio/spectral/docs/reference/openapi-rules.md).

## Error Results

Spectral has a few different error severities: `error`, `warn`, `info` and `hint`, and they are in "order" from highest to lowest. By default, all results will be shown regardless of severity, and the presence of any results will cause a failure status code of 1.

The default behavior is can be modified with the `--fail-severity=` option. Setting fail severity to `--fail-severity=warn` would return a status code of 1 for any warning results or higher, so that would also include error. Using `--fail-severity=error` will only show errors.

Changing the fail severity will not effect output. To change what results Spectral CLI prints to the screen, add the `--display-only-failures` switch (or just `-D` for short). This will strip out any results which are below the fail severity.


## Proxying

To have requests made from Spectral be proxied through a server, you'd need to specify PROXY environment variable:

`PROXY=<<PROXY_SERVER_ADDRESS>> spectral lint spec.yaml`
