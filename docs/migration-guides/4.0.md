# Spectral 2.x/3.x to 4.x Migration Guide

If you haven't written a custom ruleset or never used a config file,
it's very likely you are unaffected by any of the breaking changes we introduced,
therefore you might upgrade your Spectral version right away.

Our docs have been updated, so you can always refer to them, but to make the transition less painful,
this migration guide covers the most notable changes.

> Note: 3.0 version was a bit of a transition-version, without any significant changes, besides the config file we removed in 4.0.

### I have own rulesets...

1. `summary` property is gone

We introduced a more powerful `message` property. It not only lets you define a static message, but also lets you compose them.

If you want to have error from function printed, you can do so as follows:

```js
message: '{{error}}'
```

Printing description is equally straightforward:

```js
message: '{{description}}'
```

If you want a property key to be printed instead:

```js
message: '{{property}}'
```

Keep in mind, `property` might be an empty string.

You can also compose a fancier message if you'd like to:

```js
message: 'Errored at {{property}}... Error message is: {{error}}'
```

Let us know if there is any shorthand you'd like to see in the future.

A real-world example of the migration can be found [here](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/issues/367).

2. `jsonpath` is swapped with `jsonpath-plus`

There shouldn't be any significant differences, but `jsonpath-plus` does come with its own syntax for special selectors.
Please refer to their [docs](https://github.com/s3u/JSONPath#features) for the comprehensive list. 
You can also take a look at changes we had to make [internally](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/pull/347/commits/c79691da636f76c5b0ab5c611779d6be16d32292).

### I use Spectral via CLI...

1. Config files no longer exist

The config file (which was spectral.yml by default, or using the --config) was a combination of things that could all be done as CLI flags,
and was just meant to reduce how much you needed to type those things out.
The important stuff has been replaced with looking for a default ruleset, called .spectral.yml (notice the `.` prefix) and loading a ruleset and skipping a rule would now look like this:

```yaml
extends: spectral:oas2 # we extend all recommended rules from spectral:oas2
rules:
  operation-operationId-unique: off
```

All recommended rules from built-in OAS2 ruleset would be enabled, while operation-operationId-unique rule would be disabled entirely.
Note, you can still use `--skip-rule` flag via CLI, but we truly believe the ruleset approach is a way to go.

This change shouldn't hurt you much, as CLI support *all* flags config did, so no functionality will be missing.

You can also do more in ruleset files, see [docs](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/blob/develop/docs/rulesets.md) for more. 

2. `--max-results` flag is removed

Most users wanted to see all errors and warnings, not just a few, so it wasnâ€™t that useful.

### I use Spectral programmatically via API...

1. Import paths have changed

In 4.0 we significantly changed our release process,
therefore, as a side affect, the project structure we submit to NPM is a bit different.
You need to rewrite imports as follows:

```js
const { oas3Functions, rules: oas3Rules } = require('@stoplight/spectral/rulesets/oas3');
```

to

```js
const { oas3Functions, rules: oas3Rules } = require('@stoplight/spectral/dist/rulesets/oas3');
```

Note, the `dist` in between. This is the only difference. You'll need to apply the change to all other imports accordingly.
In future, we will simplify rulesets loading even further, so you won't need any of that.
More on that can be found [here](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/issues/366).

2. `json-ref-resolver` has been updated

If you ever provided a custom resolver, you might need to bump json-ref-resolver package to reflect the potential changes in interfaces we introduced.

As always, suggest updating `@stoplight/yaml` and `@stoplight/json` if you happened to use them.
