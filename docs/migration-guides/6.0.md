# Spectral v5 to v6 Migration Guide (WIP)

## Core

1. `schema` function uses Ajv v8 in favor of Ajv v6. It is preferred to provide JSON Schema Draft 7 schemas or newer, albeit older drafts are also supported via json-schema-migrate.
   `oasVersion` is no longer supported. Use `oasSchema` function from the OAS ruleset if you want to supply OAS Schema Object.

## CLI

1. deprecated `--show-unmatched-globs` flag has been removed. Alternative available: `--fail-on-unmatched-globs`

2. `--skip-rule` has been removed. Use a custom ruleset instead.
