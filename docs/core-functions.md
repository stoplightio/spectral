# Spectral Core Functions

Functions described here are available for use in your [rulesets](./rulesets.md).
These functions are built-in meaning you don't need to include them in any particular way.
They are just always loaded and ready to be used.
A lot of core OAS rules provided by Spectral make use of those functions.
