## üß∞ Installation

The easiest way to install spectral is to use either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli
```

Or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```
yarn global add @stoplight/spectral-cli
```

There are also [additional installation options](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjYyMDc0Mw-installation).

## üíª Usage

### 1. Create a local ruleset

Spectral, being a generic YAML/JSON linter, **needs a ruleset** to lint files. A ruleset is a JSON, YAML, or JavaScript/TypeScript file (often the file is called `.spectral.yaml` for a YAML ruleset) that contains a collection of rules, which can be used to lint other JSON or YAML files such as an API description.

To get started, run this command in your terminal to create a `.spectral.yaml` file that uses the Spectral predefined rulesets based on OpenAPI or AsyncAPI:

```bash
echo 'extends: ["spectral:oas", "spectral:asyncapi"]' > .spectral.yaml
```

If you would like to create your own rules, check out the [Custom Rulesets](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/01baf06bdd05a-rulesets) page.

### 2. Lint

Use this command if you have a ruleset file in the same directory as the documents you are linting:

```bash
spectral lint myapifile.yaml
```

Use this command to lint with a custom ruleset, or one that's located in a different directory than the documents being linted:

```bash
spectral lint myapifile.yaml --ruleset myruleset.yaml
```

## üåé Real-World Rulesets

Stoplight has a set of Spectral rulesets that were created to help users get started with Stoplight's Style Guides. You can find them on [API Stylebook](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/), and you can download the source Spectral file by selecting a style guide on the project sidebar and selecting **Export** -> **Spectral File(s)** on the top-right. A few noteworthy style guides are:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/owasp-top-10) - Set of rules to enforce [OWASP security guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/).
- [URL Style Guidelines](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/url-guidelines) - Set of rules to help developers make better and consistent endpoints.
- [Documentation](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral-documentation) - Scan an OpenAPI description to make sure you're leveraging enough of its features to help documentation tools like Stoplight Elements, ReDoc, and Swagger UI build the best quality API Reference Documentation possible.

There are also rulesets created by many companies to improve their APIs. You can use these as is to lint your OpenAPI descriptions, or use these as a reference to learn more about what rules you would want in your own ruleset:

- [Adidas](https://github.com/adidas/api-guidelines/blob/master/.spectral.yml) - Adidas were one of the first companies to release their API Style Guide in a written guide _and_ a Spectral ruleset. Lots of good rules to try in here.
- [APIs You Won't Hate](https://github.com/apisyouwonthate/style-guide) - An opinionated collection of rules based on advice in the [APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/) community.
- [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/azure-api-style-guide/blob/main/spectral.yaml) - Ruleset and complimentary style guide for creating OpenAPI 2 or 3 definitions of Azure services.
- [Box](https://github.com/box/box-openapi/blob/main/.spectral.yml) - Lots of [Custom Functions](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjI1MTkw-custom-functions) being used to enforce good practices that the Box API governance folks are interested in.
- [DigitalOcean](https://github.com/digitalocean/openapi/blob/main/spectral/ruleset.yml) - Keeping their OpenAPI nice and tidy, enforcing use of `$ref` (probably to minimize conflicts), naming conventions for Operation IDs, and all sorts of other handy OpenAPI tips.
- [Tranascom](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/swagger-def/.spectral.yml) - Don't even think about using anything other than `application/json`.
- [Zalando](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/zalando-restful-api-guidelines) - Based on [Zalando's RESTFUL API Guidelines](https://github.com/zalando/restful-api-guidelines), covers a wide-range of API topics such as versioning standards, property naming standards, the default format for request/response properties, and more.
