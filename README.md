- **Custom Rulesets**: Create custom rules to lint JSON or YAML objects
- **Ready-to-use Rulesets**: Validate and lint **OpenAPI v2 & v3** and **AsyncAPI** Documents
- **JSON Path Support**: Use JSON path to apply rules to specific parts of your objects
- **Ready-to-use Functions**: Built-in set of functions to help [create custom rules](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/docs/guides/4-custom-rulesets.md#adding-rules). Functions include pattern checks, parameter checks, alphabetical ordering, a specified number of characters, provided keys are present in an object, etc.
- **Custom Functions**: Create custom functions for advanced use cases
- **JSON Validation**: Validate JSON with [Ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv)

## ‚ùì FAQs

### How is this different to Ajv

[Ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) is a JSON Schema validator, and Spectral is a JSON/YAML linter. Instead of just validating against JSON Schema, it can be used to write rules for any sort of JSON/YAML object, which could be JSON Schema, or OpenAPI, or anything similar. Spectral does expose a [`schema` function](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/docs/reference/functions.md) that you can use in your rules to validate all or part of the target object with JSON Schema (we even use Ajv used under the hood for this), but that's just one of many functions.

### I want to lint my OpenAPI documents but don't want to implement Spectral right now.

No problem! A hosted version of Spectral comes **free** with the Stoplight platform. Sign up for a free account [here](https://stoplight.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=spectral&utm_campaign=readme).

### What is the difference between Spectral and Speccy

[Speccy](https://github.com/wework/speccy) was a great inspiration for Spectral, but was designed to work only with OpenAPI v3. Spectral can apply rules to _any_ JSON/YAML object (including OpenAPI v2/v3 and AsyncAPI). It's mostly been abandoned now, and is JavaScript not TypeScript.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Integrations

- [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio?utm_source=github&utm_medium=spectral&utm_campaign=readme) uses Spectral to validate and lint OpenAPI documents.
- [Spectral GitHub Action](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral-action), lints documents in your repo, built by [Vincenzo Chianese](https://github.com/XVincentX/).
- [VS Code Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/vscode-spectral), all the power of Spectral without leaving VS Code.
