## Spectral Features

- Create custom rules to lint JSON or YAML objects
- Ready to use rules to validate and lint OpenAPI v2 _and_ v3 documents
- Use JSON path to apply rules to specific parts of your objects
- Built-in set of functions to help [create custom rules](https://stoplight.io/p/docs/gh/stoplightio/spectral/docs/getting-started/rulesets.md#adding-a-rule). Functions include pattern checks, parameter checks, alphabetical ordering, a specified number of characters, provided keys are present in an object, etc.
- Create custom functions for advanced use cases
- Validate JSON with [Ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv)

## FAQs

### How is this different to AJV

[Ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) is a JSON Schema validator, and Spectral is a JSON/YAML linter. Instead of just validating against JSON Schema, it can be used to write rules for any sort of JSON/YAML object, which could be JSON Schema, or OpenAPI, or anything similar. Spectral does expose a [`schema` function](https://stoplight.io/p/docs/gh/stoplightio/spectral/docs/reference/functions.md) that you can use in your rules to validate all or part of the target object with JSON Schema (we even use Ajv used under the hood for this), but that's just one of many functions.

### I want to lint my OpenAPI documents but don't want to implement Spectral right now.

No problem! A hosted version of Spectral comes **free** with the Stoplight platform. Sign up for a free account [here](https://stoplight.io/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=spectral).

### What is the difference between Spectral and Speccy

[Speccy](https://github.com/wework/speccy) was a great inspiration for Spectral, but was designed to work only with OpenAPI v3. Spectral can apply rules to _any_ JSON/YAML object (including OpenAPI v2 and v3) through the use of [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) `given` parameters. Some rule types have been enhanced to be a little more flexible along with being able to create your own rules based on the built-in functions, and we've added the ability to define custom functions too.

### Example Implementations

- [Stoplight's Custom Style and Validation Rules](https://docs.stoplight.io/modeling/modeling-with-openapi/style-validation-rules) uses Spectral to validate and lint OpenAPI documents on the Stoplight platform
- [Spectral GitHub Bot](https://github.com/tbarn/spectral-bot), a GitHub pull request bot that lints your repo's OpenAPI document that uses the [Probot](https://probot.github.io) framework, built by [Taylor Barnett](https://github.com/tbarn)
- [Spectral GitHub Action](https://github.com/XVincentX/spectral-action), a GitHub Action that lints your repo's OpenAPI document, built by [Vincenzo Chianese](https://github.com/XVincentX/)
