# Stoplight Community Code of Conduct

The Stoplight Community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. 

Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. See our reporting guidelines [here](https://github.com/stoplightio/code-of-conduct/blob/master/incident-reporting.md). Our full Code of Conduct can be found at this [link](https://github.com/stoplightio/code-of-conduct/blob/master/long-form-code-of-conduct.md#long-form-code-of-conduct).
